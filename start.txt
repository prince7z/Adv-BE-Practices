to start localy first ensure we are running docker engine
then make a cluster yml  and run "kind create cluster --config cluster.yml
--name localcluster"
do docker ps to see running container 
we can hit endponts /api/v1/namespace/default/pods to see the cluster runnign
but we will not be able to fetch it cause we are not authorised 
so now we are finally running kubernates inside docker 

now we can do cubectl get nodes to see if nodes are runninng or not 
If you want to see the exact HTTP request that goes out to the API server, you
can add --v=8 flag

now we have to deploy container 

can do kubectl run nginxlocal --image=nginx --port=80
so kubernate will autometacly select the node in which to run pod
kubectl get pods to see runing podscan do kubectl lods nginx to see logs in
which pod the nginx running 
describe the pod to see more details - kubectl describe pod nginx
now we are runnign nginx image inside  a pod insde a node
to stop the pod we can do kubectl delete pod nginx 

manifest is a file tht have configration for whtever u going to run like pod ,
replicaset,deployment n all 
to run tht thing we do kubectl apply -f manifest.yml


in production we make deployment which create replicaset nd ensure the amonnt
we have asked for pods are runningn and which machine image is running there
 se the example of deployment.yml 
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: nginx-deployment
spec:
  replicas: 3
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: nginx
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: nginx
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: nginx
        image: nginx:latest
        ports:
        - containerPort: 80
kubectl apply -f deployment.yml
same to get deployment detail kubectl get deployment 
to ger rs  k get rs
 
We use deployment. To make. Things smooth. Like if any image fails. So it
ensure. That the fixed number of replica sets should work. Now think like
that. You have deployed. 3 port setup. And later you came with an update. So
you just have to change the deployment yml file. To give version two right.
Now deployment will itself handle to bring down. Itpods one by one and. Bring
up the pots one by one. If somehow any pod will fail so it will roll back to
that pod. Wigan do cubical rollout history deployment. To see all the history
of virgins. We can undo the deployment by capital rollout, undo deployment and
the next deployment. To expose the app on Internet we use services

there are 3 services nodepods,cluster ip ,loadbalancer First, the note. Gives
excess. For the pod. This will. Public you are. Ford URL. So anyone can. Do
Didos attack? It is the easiest way. To deploy. Second is load balancer. Load
balancer ensure. That all the. Fords will have the same amount of traffic. It
ensures that. Node IP. Will no longer be public. Its work as reverse proxy.
And the third one is that is used between the bots to communicate. Like how
the parts will be communicating. Depends on cluster IP.The Lord Valencia. Will
have his. Manifest file. And we apply like you could all apply. Minus
afserviceLb.yml.

So in conclusion. Make a cluster by kind yml. Using kind create cluster. Then
make a deployment yml. Add run Qadle deployment. Then expose our app over node
port. That what we usually don't do. Like we do not vote, but after that we
use a load balancer. So Northport will expose to load balancer only and the
rest of thing load balancer will handle. We have to make a. Load balance set

YML 2. As we have made for note. Yeah, that's it.
